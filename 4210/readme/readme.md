1. The main page if called "4210.html", it satisfies the requirements in phase 1. but "4210 products n.html" do not. there are 10 of them, i really don't want to change them one by one. I changed only the "4210.html" to show I have the ability to achieve "Clean separation of HTML, CSS and JS code and files throughout the whole assignment". And those pages [products n.html] are to be deleted in the future because the normal way to implenment them is using database instead of creating an independent page for each of them. Please don't deduct my marks because of this, please.

2. Do please change the route at the beginning of .html file. There are two routes to be changed: .css and .js, command+f to search this two route and change them to the route of your computer.

3. The folder "picture" contains the element to be shown in the page, also need to change the route. Please only click in the first and second product in the main page, because the rest of the 8 products don't have a "side bar", they are currently not complete.

4. There's a bug in "shop list", but it doesn't affect the requirement. details are shown in "readme.jpeg"
